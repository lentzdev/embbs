     This  week - amongst others! - A complete first draft proposal of
     a Fidonet World Policy, version 1.60.  Perhaps a bit lengthy, but
     nevertheless interesting!
     
     Maybe  you  think  that this isn't of any interest to the regular
     user  or FidoNet sysop? But then, think again... it can't hurt to
     be acquainted with the rules of your 'country': if you don't ever
     need  them,  all  the better - but if your rights as a citizen of
     FidoNet are misused or denied......
     
     The  current  official  policy  is  very  restrictive  and wasn't
     adopted  democraticly,  so with THIS proposal there is the chance
     to  be  involved  in the process and decide your own destiny (and
     that of FidoNet)...

     Static charges
     By Johan Siegers
     FidoNet 2:286/201.16
     
     In  a  computer  magazine  I  read  about  a  little  box  called
     StaticClear.  The  idea  was  that you touch a button on the box,
     which  will discharge you from any static voltages. An LC-Display
     indicated  if  you still had any high voltages. The price of this
     nice apparatus: DFL 95,-  (abt 45 $).
     
     I  think  most  of  you  have experienced static tensions. At the
     moment you touched metal, you felt an electric shock. The voltage
     at this point can be very high. 10 - 20 kV is quite normal.
     
     Electronic  equipment  is very sensitive for these high voltages.
     Especially  so-called  CMOS IC's or Eproms can be damaged easily.
     I  have  experienced  that myself. You can destroy an intergrated
     circuit without feeling anything of the statics.
     
     There  are  several  ways  to prevent these high static voltages.
     Conductive placemats, bracelets etc.
     
     I  don't  know  if  it's necessary to use any of these gears when
     you're  behind  the keyboard. As soon as you start to work in the
     interior   of  your  computer,  I  would  strongly  suggest  some
     prevention.
     
     To my opinion you can be re-loaded quit easily. A simple movement
     with  your desk chair on wheels will do. So, a constant discharge
     will be needed.
     
     When  I  want to work static-free, I take a small crocodile clamp
     and  connect  it to the bracelet of my watch. On the other end of
     the  wire,  a  resistor  of  1  Mega-ohm  and  a  second clamp is
     connected.  The resistor has two purposes: First any statics will
     be  removed  slowly,  so  I  will not feel anything. Secondly: It
     prevents me from an instant kill, in case I should touch any life
     parts.
     
     That  second  clamp  will  be  connected  to  the  housing of the
     equipment, and a ground point, like the central heating.
     
     This  way  I  have  the secure feeling that I am not carrying any
     high static voltages.
     
     Johan.

     WP 5.0 macros - Part III
     By Gerhard Hoogterp
     Fidonet 2:286/201.6
     
     So  here we go again.. at last, the real thing.. Last week I left
     you  in  WP's  macro  editor. This week more on that subject. But
     first a little review of the keys we used so far..
     
        Control-F10      Start   recording  a  macro  /  invoke  macro
                         editor / Stop recording a macro
        Alt-F10          Play a macro back
        Control-PgUp     Insert a pause into a macro
     
     and the possible macro names..
     
        Alt-<key>        One key macro
        empty name       Temporarily macro
        Filename         Named macro
     
     
     So,  lets go.. A few remarks on wordperfect's macro language: all
     the  following  points  are  only true while you are in the macro
     editor!  As you will see later on, the macro language has most of
     the  language constructions and features of normal languages like
     C  and  pascal. Things will be easier if you did some programming
     in a high level language.
     
     The general syntax of a construction is :
     
          {command} <parameter> ~
     
     The  tilde  (~)  is used to finish a parameter field. As commands
     can be nested, the forgetting a tilde is a common error.
     
     Another  point  to remember is that not every key can be typed in
     immediately  in  the macro editor. When you press the <ENTER> key
     for  example  you  are  busy  formatting  the  macro  layout, not
     inserting  a hard-return in the resulting macro. When you want to
     insert  a  key  (which  has  to  show  up  in the resulting macro
     execution)  but  which cannot be entered directly you have to use
     a  Control-V  (verbose?)  prefix.  For example : to insert a hard
     return into the macro, use the keystroke : Control-V<ENTER>
     
     So  now,  at  last...  Lets take the memo macro we worked on last
     week and add some bells and whistles.
     
     Fire  up  the macro editor by pressing Control-F10, Alt-M for our
     memo  macro  and edit to get into the edit mode.. Here you select
     option 2 to get into the edit window.
     
     Your macro should look something like this :
     
        From{Indent}{Indent}:_{Enter}
        To{Indent}{Indent}:_{Enter}
        Date{Indent}{Indent}:_{Date/Outline}2{Enter}
        Subject{Indent}{Indent}:_{Enter}
     EMBBS 1-13                   Page 4                    2 Oct 1989


        {Enter}
        {Esc}65-{Enter}
        {Enter}
        {Up}{Up}{Up}{Up}{Up}{Up}{Up}{End}{PAUSE}{Down}{PAUSE}{Down}
        {Down}{PAUSE}{Down}{Down}{Down}{Down}
     
     Please  note  that  I  use  an underscore instead of the centered
     point used by WP as ASCII values greater than 128 are not allowed
     in  EMBBS..  Also note that the keys that can normally be used on
     the  keyboard  are  in  all  lowercase  with  an  uppercase first
     character while the macro commands are in all uppercase.
     
     Let  us  clean  the  macro up a little. As you can see I used the
     up-arrow  key  seven  times to get back on the first line where a
     pause  had to be inserted into the macro. This can be replaced by
     a  {Esc}7{Up}  (no  commercial  intended  ;-) So first delete the
     seven  {Up} commands by going there with the arrow keys and press
     the  <DEL>  key  seven  times.  Then stop, inserting the {Esc} by
     pressing  escape  would  throw  you  out  of  the editor. (With a
     question  to ask whether you're sure.) Here we need the Control-V
     command  to insert the {Esc}. Press Control-V<ESC>7 to insert the
     first  part  of the replacement. The {Up} key is also used by the
     macro  editor  itself,  so  here  we also need the control-V. Use
     Control-V<UPKEY> and there we are.
     
     Noq  we go on and add some comment to the macro.. It isn't really
     necessary here, but good programming habits are a good thing when
     you start writing more complex macros.
     
     The syntax of a comment line is :
     
        {;}comment~
     
     So  go  to  the  top of the macro, press <RETURN> and.... But now
     there  is  a  problem:  Just  typing {;} won't do (the ; won't be
     highlighted   either.)   Macro   commands  are  inserted  by  the
     Control-PgUp key (one of the most important keys in WP.) So press
     Control-PgUp  and  you  will see a window pop up. You can use the
     arrowkeys  to  select  the  wanted  command  and  press return to
     select it. (You may also press a character. The selectionbar will
     be  placed  on  the  first  command which starts with the pressed
     character)  after  selecting the {;} it will be put in your macro
     command,  highlighted, and you can start to type a comment. After
     the comment you type a tilde and there you are..
     
     Look  out here, never forget the tilde! Otherwise your macro will
     not work! This is extremely important.
     
     Ok,  the  bells  and whistles.. We want to (really!) put a header
     above  the  memo.  Put the cursor under the commentline and press
     <RETURN> to insert an empty line. We want a centered line of text
     that  says  something like -=< EMBBS memo >=- which is printed in
     bold.  To  accomplice  this task press the center key (Shift-F6).
     the {Center} command will appear. Now press the bold key (F6) and
     the {Bold} command also appears. Now we can type the text...
     
     EMBBS 1-13                   Page 5                    2 Oct 1989


     But  as  you  probably know, bold is a paired code. For those who
     don't  know  yet, paired means that there are always two codes in
     the text: one to turn it on and one to turn it off. To insert the
     "off"  code  just  press  the bold key again after you typed your
     text.  The macro editor will accept this as the bold-off command.
     Now,  the  only thing you have to do is to finish the line with a
     hard-return.  So  press Control-V<ENTER> and the line should look
     like :
     
        {Center}{Bold}-=<_Embbs_memo_>=-{Bold}{Enter}
     
     Here  I  would say, save the new macro with the exit key (F7) and
     take  a  look at the result.. Flashy, isn't it!? Now you can turn
     the  From,  To,  Date and subject field bold too if you like. And
     of  course the dashed line. Be sure to put the second {bold} code
     on  the  date  line  before the {Date/Outline} command. Otherwise
     the date itself would also be in bold..
     
     So  far  for this week.. Next week I will go a little deeper into
     the  language..  But don't hesitate to experiment with it already
     on your own, it's fun...
     
     Greetings,
      Gerhard Hoogterp.

     Processing of Data - Part IV
     By Jeroen van Drie
     FidoNet 2:512/30.3
     
     This  series goes into the information interpretation differences
     between  a  computer  and  a  human, and the problems encountered
     trying  to teach a computer. These articles are just some general
     brainstorming,  and  are *not* to be taken as an authority on the
     subject.
     
     Last  week  I  described  a  structure  of processors which could
     become  slightly intelligent, but one thing is still undescribed:
     the  software.  Software  informs  and instructs the computer. It
     tells  the  computer what to do. With a multi-processor computer,
     we  could  take  one  program  to instruct the whole system or we
     could give each processor it's own software (and so also give him
     address space to a Rom or Ram). One program to instruct the whole
     implies  that  there  would  be  one central processor which uses
     other processors to do the actual task, while this computer would
     only  'but' coordinate and instruct the system. Memory addressing
     would only be nessecary for the main processor, and, depending on
     the  use,  for  some buffering processors. Each processor its own
     software  would  require  processors  which  can both address the
     range  nessecary,  and the devices to which it is connected. This
     one  is  the  most  interesting  one;  Each processor defines for
     itself  what  to  do  with  the  data,  so  the  whole  system is
     autonomously   organised.   The   processors  itself  wouldn't be
     intelligent,  but  the  whole system *could* be. (compare that to
     braincells,  which  are not seen as intelligent itself, the total
     of  the  brain is seen as intelligent.) The other structure would
     be  a  very  fast  computer,  but hardly capable of intelligence.
     Computers  are  made  to  compute, but what would a computer make
     intelligent?  Pattern  recognition?  I have discussed that in the
     first  and  second  parts  of  this  series,  and  there are some
     possibilities  for it, but pattern recognition isn't just the one
     and  only  intelligent thing we'd want the computer to do. Expert
     systems are databases, containing information provided by experts
     on  a certain field, and this information is logically linked (eg
     with   the  AI  languages  if-then  comparing  of  excluding  and
     including).  These bases ask questions to a user and by answering
     these  questions, the user can solve the problem or get an answer
     to  a  question  he  or  she  has.  Computers  also can read body
     temperature, and do some medical surgery, and with such an expert
     system,   this  computer  can  give  a  diagnosis.  This  is  not
     intelligence,  but  just using the possibilities of a computer in
     another  way.  The  basic things done within such a base are just
     comparements  of  input  with what's stored in the base, and make
     the  diagnose.  (measure  temperature:  40  degrees  celcius, the
     temperature  comes  from  a  human being: Human being is ill.) By
     giving  a computer some basic information, and with that, letting
     it  encounter some things of which it does not have a description
     (of  which  it doesn't know what it is), and by comparing that to
     what  it knows, it might come up with a self-found description of
     that  new  thing, and with that new information, the computer can
     describe new things with a more profound (self gained) knowledge.
     That  is  what  I  could  call  intelligent,  and  not so hard to
     EMBBS 1-13                   Page 7                    2 Oct 1989


     realise.
     
     And  as  this is the last article in this series, an ethical note
     is  expectable.  One  thing we should look into when we deal with
     things  like Artificial Intelligence is that we should always ask
     ourselves  a why. We have made machines who can do any action for
     us,  we  have made computers which automate series of actions and
     which  take  over  some of our functions, and we are now about to
     invent  machines which can take over our intellectual activities.
     We  should  ask  ourselves whether or not we are making ourselves
     redundant  and  dependant. The fact that all the nuclear arms are
     controlled by computers, and that, in a while, a computer decides
     whether yes or no to start an atomic war, is frightening, because
     this  computer  does  not  live.  It doesn't take everything into
     account, it doesn't have any ethics, emotion, and preservation of
     human  life  or just life on this planet is not the standard, but
     maintaining  power  structures  as  they are between nations. The
     computer  will  survive  the  blast  for a while, all automatised
     structures  will  live  on  for a while, and perhaps, this planet
     will  be  run  by computers and there will be no life form (as we
     know it) left. Scientists working on projects often classify such
     ethical  'warnings'  as  'irrational',  or  do not even take into
     account  what  the  consequences  of his findings will be when he
     publishes  it. We have heard from many a nuclear engineer that he
     would  never  have started working on those things when if he had
     known  what  the  consequences  would  be,  and when an engineer,
     working  on  it,  cannot  estimate  the  consequences,  who  can?
     A computer?
     
     Any  comments  on or additions to this fourth and final part will
     be greatly appreciated.

     FidoNet World Policy version 1.60 - Proposal
     By Ron Dwight (Zone 2 Coordinator)
     FidoNet Node 2:2/0
     
     FidoNet  SysOps,  here  is  the  FIRST proposal for a new FidoNet
     policy which will allow a large measure of democracy to exist for
     the  first time within FidoNet. It should be emphasised that this
     document  is being placed for review and comments ONLY. It is the
     FIRST  draft of a document which will be put out as the object of
     a  referendum by all SysOps in zone 2. Acceptance or rejection of
     this document by the FidoNet zone 2 SysOps will NOT automatically
     ensure  it's  placement  as  either  a zone 2 policy or a FidoNet
     policy. Your comments are NEEDED on this most important document.
     Thanks in advance.
     
     Ron Dwight, ZC2
     
     ----------
     
     
     FidoNet World Policy version 1.60
     
     Preamble
     
       It is hoped that this policy can be approved by the majority of
       FidoNet  zone  2  in order that this can either be adopted as a
       zone 2 policy and/or put forward for acceptance as a World-wide
       policy for FidoNet.
     
     
     Distribution
     
       This  document  is  put  out  for  discussion  by the SysOps of
       FidoNet  zone  2  and input/feedback is requested. This is YOUR
       FidoNet and YOUR policy.
     
     
     Synopsis
     
       This  document  contains  the  world  policy  for FidoNet. Each
       individual  that  deals with FidoNet is required to follow this
       policy.
     
       There can be other more detailed policies at the various levels
       of  FidoNet,  but  each policy must at least contain all of the
       higher   policy   and   cannot   contain   rules  that  are  in
       contradiction with a higher policy.
     
       This  document  is intended to reflect the will of the majority
       of  the  SysOps  in zone 2. If there is some section you do not
       feel  succeeds  in accomplishing this, send netmail to 2:2/0 or
       leave echomail in ENET.SYSOP.

       This  document  is  modelled after the Policy 4.7 draft made by
       Harry  Lee with a number of additions/modifications from places
       too numerous to mention.

     0. In case this is the only available policy.
     
       This  policy  comes  with examples of lower level policies. As
       long  as  no lower level policies exists, the example policies
       are considered the lower level policies.
     
     
     1   Overview
     
     1.0  Language
     
       The  official  language  in  FidoNet  is  English. All official
       documents should be or have a translation in English.
     
     
     1.1  Introduction
     
       FidoNet  is  an amateur electronic mail system. As such, all of
       its participants and operators are non-paid volunteers.
     
       FidoNet is large enough that it would quickly fall apart of its
       own  weight  unless  some  sort  of  structure and control were
       imposed  on  it.  Multinet  operation  provides  the structure.
       Decentralized management provides the control.
     
       This  document  is  an attempt to describe the procedures which
       have been developed to manage the network.
     
       It  also  gives  rules  for the behaviour of individuals on the
       net.
     
       Individuals  who  join  FidoNet  have  to  follow the following
       policies:
     
       1. This World  Policy
       2. A    Zone   Policy if available
       3. A    Region Policy if available
       4. A    Net    Policy if available
       5. A    Point  Policy if available.
     
       There is  no need to read all policies because each lower level
       policy is required to contain all of the higher policies.
     
       If  the  individual joins one or more EchoMail Conferences that
       individual is required to follow a seperate EchoMail Policy.
     
     
     1.1.1  Compliance with Laws
     
     EMBBS 1-13                   Page 10                   2 Oct 1989


        All  FidoNet  systems  will comply with all applicable laws of
        the  locality  in  which  those  systems  operate.  These laws
        include  but are not limited to, laws governing the activities
        of computer users and/or networks, copyright laws, libel laws,
        sedition laws, and laws protecting individual civil rights.
     
        Utilizing   FidoNet   position  or  FidoNet  structure  in the
        commission  of  a  crime will be grounds for immediate removal
        from FidoNet.
     
     
     1.2  Organization
     
     1.2.1  General
     
       FidoNet  nodes  are  grouped  on  several  levels. These are as
       follows:
     
     
     1.2.2  Points
     
       A  point  is  a  FidoNet  compatible  system that is not in the
       nodelist,  but  communicates with FidoNet regularly through one
       or  more  regular  nodes.  Within the scope of this document, a
       point is regarded in the same manner as a user.
     
     
     1.2.3  Nodes
     
       A  node  is  a  single  FidoNet  address,  and  is the smallest
       recognized unit of FidoNet.
     
     
     1.2.4  Networks
     
       A  network  is  a  collection of nodes, usually in a relatively
       local geographic area.  Networks coordinate their mail activity
       to decrease cost and increase mail throughput.
     
     
     1.2.5  Regions
     
       A  region  is  a  well defined geographic area containing nodes
       which  may  or  may  not  be  combined into networks. A typical
       region   will  contain  many  nodes  in  networks,  and  a  few
       independent nodes, which are not a part of any network.
     
     
     1.2.6  Zones
     
       A  zone  is  a  large  geographic area containing many regions,
       covering one or more countries and/or continents.
     
     
     1.2.7  FidoNet
     
     EMBBS 1-13                   Page 11                   2 Oct 1989


       This  indicates  the  entire  public  amateur  mail  network as
       defined   by   the   weekly  node  list,  issued  by  the  Zone
       Coordinators  described  elsewhere  in  this document, with the
       copyright entrusted to the International FidoNet Association by
       the  system  operators  of FidoNet. The trustee of the nodelist
       copyright can be changed by simple amendment to this document.
     
     
     1.3  Definitions
     
     1.3.1  FidoNews
     
       FidoNews  is an important medium by which SysOps hear from each
       other. FidoNews helps give us the sense of being a community of
       people with common interests.
     
       Accordingly,   you   should   encourage  SysOps  and  users  to
       contribute  to  FidoNews.  If  you  receive any submissions for
       FidoNews, you should provide the submittor assistance in seeing
       to it the submissions reach the Editor of FidoNews.
     
       Translations  in  other  languages  and  distribution  of  the
       translated version is encouraged.
     
     
     1.3.2  Geography
     
       With  rare  exceptions, each level of FidoNet is geographically
       contained  by  the  level  immediately  above  it. (The logical
       extension  of  this is that if a node is physically in the area
       of  a  local  network,  it  should  BE  in that network, not an
       independent  in  the  region.)  Network  geography is generally
       based  on  local calling areas. Even in the case of areas where
       node  density  is so great that more than one network is needed
       to  serve  one  local  calling  area, some geographic guideline
       should be used to decide which nodes belong to what network.
     
       Local network membership is based on geographic or other purely
       technical  rationale.  It  should not be based upon personal or
       social factors.
     
       There   are  cases  where  the  local  calling  areas  lead  to
       situations  where  it  is  logical for a node physically in one
       FidoNet  Region  to belong to another. In those cases, with the
       explicit  agreement  of  the  Regional  Coordinators  and  Zone
       Coordinator   involved,   exemptions   may   be  granted.  Such
       exemptions   are  neither  a  right,  nor  permanent,  and  are
       described in more detail in the Regional Coordinator section of
       this document.
     
     
     1.3.3  Zone Mail Hour (nee Network Mail Hour)
     
       Historically,  the  core  to  FidoNet has been the Network Mail
       Hour  -  a  time  at  which  all  FidoNet  boards  are reserved
       exclusively for electronic mail exchange.
     EMBBS 1-13                   Page 12                   2 Oct 1989


       Network Mail Hour has changed in recent years, to a point where
       it should be called Zone Mail Hour.  Within the context of this
       document,  Network  Mail  Hour,  and  Zone  Mail  Hour are used
       interchangeably.
     
     
     1.3.4  Node List
     
       A  file  updated  weekly  that  contains  the  addresses of all
       recognized  FidoNet  nodes.  This file is made available by the
       Zone  Coordinator not later than Saturday ZMH, and is available
       electronically  for  download  or file request at no charge. If
       partly  nodelist  are published on lower levels in FidoNet, all
       parts  that  make  up  the  world  nodelist  should  always  be
       available on the IC's and ZC's system. The RC's are required to
       carry  all  parts  that  make  up  the  zone  nodelist. Derived
       policies should further detail this.
     
       The  full  list  that is published by the IC is regarded as THE
       FidoNet  nodelist  and used in circumstances where the nodelist
       is important (voting etc).
     
     
     1.4  The Levels of FidoNet
     
     1.4.1   General
     
       With  the  introduction of multinet Fido in early 1985, FidoNet
       has  developed  a  hierarchical  structure,  with the following
       levels:
     
     
     1.4.2   International Coordinator
     
       The  International Coordinator coordinates the joint production
       of the master nodelist by the Zone Coordinators.
     
       The  International Coordinator acts as the chairman of the Zone
       Coordinator   Council   and  also  acts  as  the  "overseer  of
       elections",   arranging  the  announcement  of  referenda,  the
       collection  and  counting  of  the  ballots, and announcing the
       results for those issues that affect FidoNet as a whole.
     
     
     1.4.3   Zone Coordinator Council
     
       The  Zone  Coordinators  in exceptional cases work jointly as a
       council.  In  particular,  this  council  comes  into play when
       inter-zonal issues need to be addressed.  This includes, but is
       not   limited   to:  working  out  the  details  of  node  list
       production,  mediating  inter-zonal  disputes,  overseeing  the
       creation of new zones, and such issues not addressed at a lower
       level  of  FidoNet.  The Zone Council also addresses complaints
       against a Zone Coordinator.
     
       The  Zone  Coordinator  Council is the last level of appeal for
     EMBBS 1-13                   Page 13                   2 Oct 1989


       any Policy complaint.
     
       The  Zone  Coordinator  Council decides on the formation of new
       zones,  and  is  responsible for assigning previously uncovered
       areas to existing zones.
     
     
     1.4.4   Zone Coordinator
     
       The  Zone  Coordinator  compiles the node lists from all of the
       regions  in  the  zone,  and  creates  the master node list and
       update  file,  which  is  then distributed over FidoNet. A Zone
       Coordinator performs no routing services for the Zone.
     
     
     1.4.5   Regional Coordinator
     
       The  Regional  Coordinator  maintains  the  list of independent
       nodes  in  the  region  and accepts node lists from the Network
       Coordinators  in  the  same  region.  The  Regional Coordinator
       compiles  these  lists  to  create a regional node list for the
       region, which is then sent to the Zone Coordinator.  A Regional
       Coordinator  does not perform routing services for any nodes in
       the region.
     
     
     1.4.6   Network Coordinator
     
       The Network Coordinator is responsible for maintaining the list
       of  nodes  for the network, and for arranging the receiving and
       forwarding of any mail coming to the network from other FidoNet
       nodes.
     
     
     1.4.7   Network Routing Hub
     
       Network Routing Hubs exist only in three-tiered networks.  They
       generally  share  some  or  all  of  the  duties of the Network
       Coordinator,  in  order  to  ease  the  management  of  a large
       network.  The  exact duties and procedures are a matter for the
       Network  Coordinator  and  the  hubs to settle, and will not be
       discussed here, except to say that a Network Coordinator CANNOT
       delegate  responsibility  to  mediate  disputes to the hub. The
       Network  Coordinator  is  still responsible for the maintenance
       and operation of the network.
     
     
     1.4.8   System Operator
     
       The  system  operators (SysOps) formulates their own policy for
       running their boards and dealing with their users, so that will
       not  be  discussed  in  this  document. However, the SysOp must
       also  mesh  with  the rest of the FidoNet system if they are to
       send and receive mail, and that will be discussed here.
     
     
     EMBBS 1-13                   Page 14                   2 Oct 1989


     1.4.9   User
     
       Policy  and  procedures  for  the  individual user on any given
       board  is  determined by the system operator of that board, and
       will not be considered in this document.  However, the SysOp is
       responsible for the actions of any user while using the node in
       so  far  as  they  affect the rest of FidoNet. (I.E., if one of
       your users is being annoying, you are being annoying!)
     
       Within  the  scope  of this document, points are users, as well
       the author of any message from anyone other than a FidoNet node
       listed  SysOp. Any traffic entering FidoNet, by whatever means,
       via  a  given  node,  if  not  from  the SysOp of the board, is
       considered  to  be  from  a  user  of  that  board,  and is the
       responsibility of the SysOp.
     
     
     1.4.10  Summary
     
       These  levels  act to distribute the administration and control
       of  FidoNet  to the lowest possible level, while still allowing
       for   coordinated   action   over   the   entire  mail  system.
       Administration  is  made  possible  by  operating in a top-down
       manner.  That is, a person at any given level is responsible to
       the level above, and responsible for the level below.
     
       For  example,  a  Regional Coordinator is solely responsible to
       the Zone Coordinator for anything that may or may not happen in
       the region. From the point of view of the Zone Coordinator, the
       Regional  Coordinator is totally and completely responsible for
       the  smooth  operation of that region. Likewise, from the point
       of  view  of the Regional Coordinator, the Network Coordinators
       are totally and completely responsible for the smooth operation
       of their networks.
     
       Lower  level  policies  must  clearly  point  out  exactly  how
       coordinators  are  appointed or selected. These procedures must
       incorporate the facts that:-
     
       If  a  person at any level above SysOp is unable for any reason
       to  properly  perform their duties, the coordinator at the next
       level can call for their replacement.
     
       For  example,  if  a Regional Coordinator is failing to perform
       the  required  duties,  the  Zone  Coordinator  can  cause  the
       Regional Coordinator to be replaced.
     
       In  case  a  lower level policy is not established and approved
       the   next   higher   level   coordinator  is  responsible  for
       appointment/selection  of  the  coordinator  on  the next lower
       level.
     
     
     2   SysOp Procedures
     
     2.1  General
     EMBBS 1-13                   Page 15                   2 Oct 1989


     2.1.1   The Basics
     
       A  SysOp  of  an  individual  node  can  pretty much do as they
       please,  as  long  as  they  observe  the  mail  events, is not
       excessively  annoying  to  other nodes on FidoNet, and does not
       promote   or   participate   in  the  distribution  of  pirated
       copyrighted software or other illegal behavior via FidoNet.
     
     
     2.1.2   Familiarity with Policy
     
       In  order  to understand the meaning of "Excessively Annoying",
       it  is  incumbent  upon  all  SysOps to occasionally re-read or
       otherwise  refresh their understanding of the FidoNet policy in
       effect.  A  new  SysOp must familiarize themselves with FidoNet
       policy before requesting a node number.
     
     
     2.1.3  Responsible for All Traffic Entering FidoNet Via that Node
     
       A  SysOp  is  responsible  for all traffic entering FidoNet via
       their  system.  This  includes  (but is not limited to) traffic
       entered by users, points, and any other networks they might act
       as  a  gateway  for.  If  a  SysOp allows "outside" messages to
       access  FidoNet  via  the system, they have a responsibility to
       ensure  the  system  is  clearly  identified  by a FidoNet node
       number   as  the  point  of  origin  of  that  message,  and  a
       responsibility  to  act  as a gateway in the reverse direction.
       Should  such traffic result in a violation of Policy, the SysOp
       must rectify the situation, under pain of excommunication.
     
     
     2.1.4   Encryption, Privacy, and the Routing of Mail
     
       FidoNet  is  an Amateur system. Our technology is such that the
       privacy  of  messages  cannot  be  guaranteed,  and  our social
       structure  is such that FidoNet should not be used for anything
       you  really  want  kept private. Any SysOp acting in an agreed-
       upon  routing  capacity,  netmail or echomail, has the absolute
       right  to  review  traffic flowing through their own system, if
       for  no  other  reason than to ensure their system is not being
       used  for  illegal or commercial purposes. Encryption obviously
       makes  this  impossible. Therefore, encrypted and/or commercial
       traffic  that  is  routed without the express permission of all
       the links in the delivery system constitutes annoying behavior.
       If a SysOp in any capacity decides not to route a message where
       they  had  previously agreed to perform such routing, they must
       preserve it, and either notify or return it to the SysOp of the
       node  at  which  the  message  entered  FidoNet.  Intentionally
       stopping an in transit message without following this procedure
       constitutes  annoying  behavior.  In  the  case of a failure to
       forward  traffic  due  to  some  technical problem, it does not
       become  annoying  unless it persists after being pointed out to
       the SysOp.
     
       Summary:
     EMBBS 1-13                   Page 16                   2 Oct 1989


       It  IS  permitted  to  transmit  encrypted mail and/or EchoMail
       provided that ALL the links carrying that encrypted Mail and/or
       EchoMail  agree  to  do  so.  The  use  of  encrypted  mail  is
       encouraged,   for   security  purposes,  in  electronic  voting
       procedures.
     
     
     2.1.5   No Alteration of Routed Mail
     
       A  SysOp  may not modify, other than as required for routing or
       other  technical  purposes,  any  message, netmail or echomail,
       routed  through  their system from one FidoNet node to another.
       (If  a  SysOp  is  offended  by  the  content of a message, the
       procedure   described   in   the  previous  paragraph  must  be
       followed.)
     
     
     2.1.6   No Disclosure of Private Net Mail
     
       Disclosing or in any way using information contained in private
       Net  Mail  traffic  not  addressed  to you or written by you is
       considered  annoying  behavior, regardless of how you come upon
       that  traffic.  This  does  NOT apply to EchoMail, which is, by
       definition, a broadcast medium, and where private mail is often
       used to keep a SysOp only area SysOp only.
     
     
     2.1.7   Not Routing Mail
     
       Conversely,  a  SysOp  is  not required to route traffic unless
       previously  agreed, and is not obliged to route traffic for all
       if  it  is  routed  for  any,  unless  voluntarily  acting in a
       coordinator position specified elsewhere in this document, or a
       document  deriving  its  authority  from  this. Routing traffic
       through  a  node  not  obligated  to  perform  routing  by this
       document   without   the   express   permission  of  that  node
       constitutes   annoying   behavior.  This  includes  unsolicited
       echomail.
     
     
     2.1.8   Exclusivity of Zone Mail Hour
     
       Zone Mail Hour is the heart of FidoNet, as this is when network
       mail is passed between systems. Any system which wishes to be a
       part  of  FidoNet must be able to receive mail from any node in
       the  node  list  during  this  time.  This  time is exclusively
       reserved for Net Mail.  Many phone systems charge on a per call
       basis,  regardless  of  whether  a connect, no connect, or busy
       signal is encountered. For this reason, any activity other than
       normal network mail processing that ties up a system during ZMH
       is   considered  annoying  behavior.  Echomail  should  not  be
       transferred  during  ZMH.  User  (BBS)  access  to  a system is
       inhibited  during  ZMH.  A  system which is a member of a local
       network may also be required to observe additional mail events,
       as  defined  by  the  Network Coordinator. (Access restrictions
       during  local  network periods is left to the discretion of the
     EMBBS 1-13                   Page 17                   2 Oct 1989


       Network Coordinator.)
     
     
     2.1.9   Private Nodes
     
       The rare exception to ZMH compliance is Private Nodes.  In this
       age  of points, Private Nodes are an anachronism, and should be
       discouraged.  In  exceptional  cases,  Private Nodes still have
       uses.  In  these  cases,  the  exact  manner and timing of mail
       delivery is left to be agreed between the SysOp and the hub. An
       agreement  for same between a SysOp and a hub is not binding on
       any  replacement  for  that  hub. By definition, a private node
       must be a part of a network (they cannot be independents in the
       region.)  In  general,  even private nodes should be encouraged
       to honor ZMH.
     
     
     2.1.10  Observing Mail Events
     
       Failure to observe the proper mail events is sufficient grounds
       for  any  node to be dropped from FidoNet without notice (since
       notice is generally given by FidoNet mail).
     
     
     2.1.11  Use Up to Date Node List
     
       Network  mail  systems  generally operate unattended, and place
       calls  at  odd hours of the night. If a system tries to call an
       incorrect  or  out  of  date  number,  it could cause some poor
       citizen's  phone  to ring in the wee hours of the morning, much
       to  the annoyance of innocent bystanders and civil authorities.
       For  this reason, a SysOp who sends mail is obligated to obtain
       and  use  the  most  recent  edition  of  the  node  list as is
       practical.
     
     
     2.1.12  Excommunication
     
       A  system which has been dropped from the network is said to be
       excommunicated  (i.e.  unable to communicate). If you find that
       you  have  been excommunicated without warning, then that means
       that  your  coordinator  was  unable to contact you. You should
       rectify the problem and report back.
     
     
     2.1.13  Timing of Zone Mail Hour
     
       The  exact timing of Zone Mail Hour is set for each zone by the
       Zone Coordinator.
     
     
     2.1.14  Non-observance of Daylight Savings Time
     
       FidoNet does not observe daylight savings time.  In areas which
       observe  daylight  savings time the FidoNet mail schedules must
       be  adjusted  in  the  same  direction  as  the  clock  change.
     EMBBS 1-13                   Page 18                   2 Oct 1989


       Alternatively,  you  can  simply  leave your system on standard
       time.
     
     
     2.2  How to obtain a node number
     
       Lower  level  policies  must  detail  how  a  nodenumber can be
       obtained.
     
     
     2.3  If You are Going Down
     
       If  your  node will be down for an extended period (more than a
       day or two), then you should inform your coordinator as soon as
       possible.  If you do not do this, then other systems will still
       try  to  reach you while you are down, much to the annoyance of
       everyone.  Do  not  under  any  circumstances  put an answering
       machine  or  similar  device  on  your phone line while you are
       down.  If  you  do,  then  calling systems will get the machine
       repeatedly,  racking  up  large  phone  bills,  which  is  very
       annoying. See the section on Resolution of Disputes for details
       on what happens to annoying people.
     
       If  you  will be leaving your system unattended for an extended
       period  of time (such as while you are on vacation), you should
       notify  your coordinator. Systems do have a tendency to "crash"
       now  and  then,  so  you will probably want your coordinator to
       know  that  it is a temporary condition if it happens while you
       are away.
     
     
     2.4  Joining a Network
     
       Lower level policies must detail this.
     
     
     2.5  How to Form a Network
     
       Lower level policies must detail this
     
     
     3   General Procedures for All Coordinators
     
     3.1  Make Available Policy, Node Lists, Updates, and FidoNews
     
       Any   Coordinator  is  responsible  for  obtaining  and  making
       available,  as  soon  as  is practical, the most recent FidoNet
       Policies, Node List, Updates, and FidoNews.
     
     
     3.2  Processing Node List Changes and Passing Them Upstream
     
       Each   coordinator  is  responsible  for  obtaining  node  list
       information  from  the  level below, processing it, and passing
       the  results  along  to  the  level  above.  The timing of this
       process  is determined by the requirements imposed by the level
     EMBBS 1-13                   Page 19                   2 Oct 1989


       above.
     
     
     3.3  Ensure the Latest Policy is Available
     
       A Coordinator is responsible to make the most recent version of
       this  document  available to those at the next level below, and
       to encourage familiarity with it.
     
       In addition, a coordinator is required to pass up the chain any
       local policies received, and to review such policies.  Although
       not  required, common courtesy dictates that when formulating a
       local  policy, the participation of the next level up should be
       solicited.
     
       Local  Policy  is  strictly an informal arrangement. Other than
       local  network  hours,  a  local policy may not mandate more or
       less than this document, or any document deriving its authority
       from this.
     
     
     3.4  Coordinators Should Minimize the Number of Hats Worn
     
       While  it is not a requirement, it is strongly suggested that a
       FidoNet  Coordinator  limit  the  number  of  FidoNet functions
       performed.  In  particular,  a  coordinator's  system should be
       readily  available  to  the levels immediately above and below,
       and a coordinator should not be in a position to rule on appeal
       on a decision made while wearing another hat.
     
       Coordinators  are discouraged from acting as major echomail and
       software  distribution  hubs. At the very least, if they do so,
       they  should  endeavor  to  handle  echomail  (or  other volume
       distribution)  on  a  system  other  than  that  listed  as the
       administrative system.
     
       Another   reason  to  discourage  multiple  hats  is  replacing
       services   if   someone   leaves  the  network.  If  a  Network
       Coordinator,  for  instance, is the major echomail hub, and the
       major  software  distribution hub for a network, those services
       will  be  that  much  more  difficult  to  restore  should  the
       coordinator resign.
     
     
     3.5  Be a Member of the Area Administered
     
       A  coordinator  must be a member of the area administered. That
       is,  a  Network Coordinator must be a member of that network by
       virtue  of  geography.  A  Region  Coordinator must be either a
       member  of  a  network in that region, or an independent of the
       region.
     
     
     3.6  Operate a Publicly Available BBS
     
       In order to meet the goal of encouraging the growth of FidoNet,
     EMBBS 1-13                   Page 20                   2 Oct 1989


       a  coordinator  must  operate  a bulletin board system which is
       freely  available  for  the  purpose  of  distributing  Policy,
       FidoNews,  and  Node Lists to potential new SysOps. (Only those
       functions  need  be freely available to first time callers - in
       all  other aspects, the policies of the board may be determined
       by the coordinator.)
     
     
     3.7  Tradition and Precedent
     
       A coordinator is NOT bound by the practices of a predecessor or
       peers beyond the scope of this document.
     
       In  addition,  a  new  coordinator  has the right to review any
       decision  made  by any predecessors for compliance with Policy,
       and  take  whatever  actions  may  be  necessary to rectify any
       situations not in compliance.
     
     
     3.8  Technical Management
     
       The  primary  responsibility  of  any  coordinator is technical
       management  of  network operations. Management decisions should
       be made strictly on technical grounds.
     
     
     4   Network Coordinator Procedures
     
     4.1  Responsibilities
     
       A Network Coordinator has the following responsibilities:
     
       1)  To  receive  incoming  mail  for  nodes in the network, and
           arrange delivery to its recipients.
     
       2) To assign node numbers to nodes in the network.
     
       3)  To  maintain  the  node list for the network, and to send a
           copy of it to the Regional Coordinator whenever it changes.
     
       4)  To   make  available  to  nodes  within  the  network,  new
           international  node  list  updates, new issues of FidoNews,
           and new revisions of Policy Documents as they are received,
           and  to  periodically check to insure that nodes within the
           network use up to date node lists.
     
     
     4.2  Routing Inbound Mail
     
       It  is your responsibility as Network Coordinator to coordinate
       the receipt of, and forwarding to the recipient any host routed
       inbound  normal  net  mail  for  nodes in your network. You are
       left to your own discretion as to how best to accomplish this.
     
       There are certain exceptions to this. If a node in your network
       is sending and receiving inordinately large volumes of mail you
     EMBBS 1-13                   Page 21                   2 Oct 1989


       can  request  that they cease and desist routing these volumes.
       If  the  node  refuses  to  do  so,  then  you can request your
       Regional  Coordinator  to  assign  the  node  a  number  as  an
       independent and drop the node from your node list.
     
       There   are   two  main  reasons  why  a  node  might  generate
       exceptionally  large  volumes  of  mail. Once in a while a node
       will  try  to  make  a  "bombing run" (sending one message to a
       great  many  nodes).  If  these  are  being routed through your
       outbound host, then you can request that they cease and desist,
       on  pain  of  excommunication.  If a node in another network is
       making bombing runs on your nodes and routing them through your
       inbound  host,  then  you  can  complain  to the network and/or
       Regional  Coordinator  of  the offending node. Bombing runs are
       considered to be annoying, and may be dealt with accordingly.
     
       The  other  common  source  of  routing  overload  is EchoMail.
       EchoMail is a nice invention, and offers great benefits, but it
       cannot  be  allowed to degrade the ability of FidoNet to handle
       normal  message  traffic.  If a node in your network is routing
       large  volumes  of  EchoMail,  you  can  ask the node to either
       limit  the amount of EchoMail, or even to stop routing EchoMail
       completely.  The design of EchoMail is such that it is a simple
       matter  to  do either of these. You are not required to forward
       encrypted,  commercial,  or  illegal  mail.  However,  you must
       follow  the  procedures  described  elsewhere  in this document
       should you decide on this course.
     
     
     4.3  Assigning Node Numbers
     
       It  is  your responsibility to assign node numbers to new nodes
       in  your  network.  You may also change the numbers of existing
       nodes in your network, though you should check with your member
       nodes before doing so.  You may assign any numbers you wish, so
       long as each node has a unique number within your network.
     
       You  should  not  assign a node number to any system unless and
       until  you  have  received a formal request from that system by
       FidoNet  mail.  This  will  ensure  that the system is at least
       minimally  operational.  The  strict maintenance of this policy
       has been one of the great strengths of FidoNet.
     
       It  is  also  recommended, though not required, that you call a
       board which is applying for a node number before assigning it a
       node number.
     
       You  may  not assign a node number to a node in an area covered
       by  an  existing network. Further, if you have nodes in an area
       covered  by  a  network  in  formation,  those  nodes should be
       transferred to the new network.
     
       You  should use network mail to inform a new node of their node
       number,  as  this  helps  to  insure  that  they are capable of
       receiving network mail.
     
     EMBBS 1-13                   Page 22                   2 Oct 1989


     4.4  Maintaining the Node List
     
       As  a  Network Coordinator, you have a dual role in maintaining
       the node list for your network.
     
       You  should  attempt  to  implement  name changes, phone number
       changes,  and  so  forth in this node list as soon as possible.
       You  should  also  on  occasion send a message to every node in
       your  network  to  ensure that they are still operational. If a
       node  turns out to be "off the air" with no prior warning given
       to you, then you can either mark the node as down, or remove it
       from the node list completely, at your own discretion.
     
       At  your  discretion,  you  may  distribute  a  portion of this
       workload to your routing hubs. In this case, you should receive
       the  node  lists from the Hub Coordinators within your network.
       You  should  assemble a master node list for your network every
       week  and  send  it to your Regional Coordinator by the day and
       time  designated  by  the Regional Coordinator. It is suggested
       that  you do this as late as is practical, so as to accommodate
       any late changes.
     
       You  will  need  to  maintain  a set of node lists for each hub
       within  your  network,  since  you  cannot  count on getting an
       update from each Hub Coordinator every week.
     
     
     4.5  Making Available Policies, Node Lists and FidoNews
     
       As  a  Network  Coordinator  you  should  obtain a new issue of
       FidoNews  and  a new international node list update every week.
       The node list update is posted weekly on Saturday, and FidoNews
       is  published  weekly on Monday. Both will be made available to
       you by your Regional Coordinator.
     
       You  should  also obtain the most recent versions of the Policy
       documents that bind the members of your network, and make those
       available  to  the nodes in your network. Policies are released
       at  sporadic  intervals, so you should also inform the nodes in
       your  network  when such events occur, and ensure the nodes are
       generally familiar with the changes.
     
       You  should make all of these available to your member nodes as
       soon  as  is  practical  after  you  receive  them.  It is also
       desirable  that you make them both available for downloading by
       the  general  user, but this is not required. However, you must
       ensure  that  at  least  one  node in your network has the most
       recent  policies, node list, update, and FidoNews available for
       downloading  as  well  as file request (at no charge and with a
       minimum of fol-de-rol).
     
       Policy,  FidoNews, and the node list are the glue that holds us
       together.  Without them, we cease to be a community, and become
       just another random collection of bulletin boards.

     4.6 Selection
     
       The  Network Coordinator is selected, from amongst the ranks of
       the  SysOps  in  the  network,  by  the  SysOps,  by democratic
       election   process.  This  process  to  be  held  according  to
       balloting procedures described later on a 'One SysOp, one vote'
       principle.
     
       The  Regional  Coordinator  may veto the result of the election
       and  call  for  a  new  election.  Under all circumstances, the
       results of the second election are binding.
     
       A  Network Coordinator can be removed by either an absolute 2/3
       majority  of  the Network SysOps, or by the impeachment process
       described   elsewhere   in  this  document.  Neither  of  these
       processes requires specific policy violations.
     
     
     5   Regional Coordinator Procedures
     
     5.1  Responsibilities
     
       A Regional Coordinator has the following responsibilities:
     
       1) To assign node numbers to independent nodes in the region.
     
       2) To  encourage  independent  nodes  in  the  region  to  join
          existing networks, or to form new networks.
     
       3) To  assign  network  numbers  to  networks in the region and
          define their boundaries.
     
       4) To   compile  a  node  list  of  all  of  the  networks  and
          independents  in the region, and to send a copy of it to the
          Zone Coordinator whenever it changes.
     
       5) To  ensure  the  smooth  operation  of  networks  within the
          region.
     
       6) To  make  new international node list updates, Policies, new
          issues  of FidoNews available to the Network Coordinators in
          the region as soon as is practical.
     
     
     5.2  Assigning Node Numbers
     
       It  is  your responsibility to assign node numbers to new nodes
       in  your  region.  You  may also change the numbers of existing
       nodes  in  your  region,  though  you  should  check  with  the
       respective  nodes  before  doing so. You may assign any numbers
       you  wish, so long as each node has a unique number within your
       region.
     
       You  should  not  assign a node number to any system unless and
       until  you  have  received a formal request from that system by
       FidoNet  mail.  This  will  ensure  that the system is at least
     EMBBS 1-13                   Page 24                   2 Oct 1989


       minimally  operational.  The  strict maintenance of this policy
       has been one of the great strengths of FidoNet.
     
       It  is  also  recommended, though not required, that you call a
       board which is applying for a node number before assigning it a
       node number.
     
       You  should use network mail to inform a new node of their node
       number,  as  this  helps  to  insure  that  they are capable of
       receiving network mail.
     
       If  a  node in your region is acting in a sufficiently annoying
       manner,  then  you  can  take  whatever  action  you  deem fit,
       according to the circumstances of the case.
     
       If  you receive a node number request from outside your region,
       you  should  forward  it  to the most local coordinator for the
       requestor as you can determine.
     
       If you receive a node number request from a new node that is in
       an  area  covered by an existing network, then you must forward
       the  request  to  the  Coordinator  of  that network instead of
       assigning a number yourself.
     
       If  a  network  forms in an area for which you have independent
       nodes,  those nodes will be transferred to the local network as
       soon as is practical.
     
     
     5.3  Encouraging the Formation and Growth of Networks
     
       One of your main duties as a Regional Coordinator is to promote
       the growth of networks in your region.
     
       You should try to avoid having independent nodes in your region
       which  are  within  the  coverage area of a network. There are,
       however, certain cases where a node should not be a member of a
       network,  such  as  a  commercial system with a large volume of
       traffic  which  would  clog the network. The resolution of such
       special cases is left to your own discretion.
     
       If  several  independent nodes in your region are in a "clump",
       then  you should encourage them to form a network. Refer to the
       SysOp  procedure  on  forming  a  network  for  details of what
       procedures to follow.
     
       Note  that  this  does  not  mean to encourage the formation of
       trivial networks.  Obviously, one node does not make a network.
       The  exact  number  of  nodes required for an effective network
       must be judged according to the circumstances of the situation,
       and is left to your own discretion.
     
     
     5.4  Assigning Network Numbers
     
       It  is  your  responsibility  to  assign network numbers to new
     EMBBS 1-13                   Page 25                   2 Oct 1989


       networks forming within your region. You are assigned a pool of
       network   numbers   to  use  for  this  purpose  by  your  Zone
       Coordinator.   As   a   part   of  this  function,  it  is  the
       responsibility  of  the  Regional  Coordinator  to  define  the
       boundaries of the networks in the region.
     
     
     5.5  Maintaining the Node List
     
       As  a Regional Coordinator, you have a dual role in maintaining
       the node list for your region.
     
       First,  you must maintain the list of independent nodes in your
       region.  You  should  attempt  to implement name changes, phone
       number  changes,  and  so  forth  in  this node list as soon as
       possible.  You  should also on occasion send a message to every
       independent  node  in your region to ensure that they are still
       operational.  If  a  node turns out to be "off the air" with no
       prior  warning  given to you, then you can either mark the node
       as  down,  or  remove it from the node list completely, at your
       own  discretion.  Second,  you must receive the node lists from
       the   Network  Coordinators  within  your  region.  You  should
       assemble a master node list for your region every week and send
       it  to  your Zone Coordinator by the day and time designated by
       the  Zone Coordinator. It is suggested that you do this as late
       as is practical, so as to accommodate any late changes.
     
       You  will need to maintain a set of node lists for each network
       within your region, since you cannot count on getting an update
       from each Network Coordinator every week.
     
     
     5.6  Geographic Exemptions
     
       There  are  cases where local calling geography does not follow
       FidoNet  regions.  In  exceptional  cases, exemptions to normal
       geographic   guidelines   are   agreed  upon  by  the  Regional
       Coordinators  and  Zone Coordinator involved. Such an exemption
       is  not  a  right, and is not forever. When a network is formed
       in the proper region that would provide local calling access to
       the  exempted node, it is no longer exempt. An exemption may be
       reviewed  and  revoked  at  any time by any of the coordinators
       involved.
     
     
     5.7  Overseeing Network Operations
     
       It  is  your  responsibility  as Regional Coordinator to ensure
       that  the  networks  within  your  region  are  operating in an
       acceptable  manner. This does not mean that you are required to
       operate  those  networks;  that  is  the  responsibility of the
       Network  Coordinators.  It  means  that you are responsible for
       seeing  to  it that the Network Coordinators within your region
       are acting responsibly.
     
       If  you  find  that a Network Coordinator within your region is
     EMBBS 1-13                   Page 26                   2 Oct 1989


       not  properly  performing  required duties (as outlined above),
       then  you  should  take  whatever  action you deem necessary to
       correct the situation.
     
       If  a  network  grows  to  a  size  that  it  cannot reasonably
       accommodate  traffic  flow  during  the  Zone  Mail  Hour,  the
       Regional Coordinator can direct the creation of one or more new
       networks  from that network, and the newly created networks can
       (and  probably  will)  be  exempted  from the usual "local call
       geography" guidelines used to define network topologies.
     
       It  is  your  obligation  as  Regional  Coordinator to maintain
       direct  and  reasonably  frequent  contact with the networks in
       your region.  The exact method of accomplishing this is left to
       your discretion.
     
     
     5.8  Making Available Node Lists, Policies, and FidoNews
     
       As  a Regional Coordinator, it is your responsibility to obtain
       the  latest  international node list updates, network policies,
       and the latest issues of FidoNews as they are published, and to
       make  them  available  to  the Network Coordinators within your
       region.  The node list is posted weekly on Saturday by the Zone
       Coordinator, and FidoNews is published weekly on Monday by node
       1/1.  Contact them for more details on how to obtain the latest
       copies  each  week.  Please  note  that  there  are  two  lists
       published  by the ZC, the Zone only list and the worldlist. The
       worldlist may differ from the official list published by the IC
       due  to  technical problems with the interchange of the updates
       between the ZC's in some rare circumstances. The list published
       by  the IC will be regarded as 'THE NODELIST' in cases where we
       refer to such a list.
     
       It  is  your  responsibility  to  make  these  available to all
       Network  Coordinators  in  your  region as soon as is practical
       after  you  receive them. The method of distribution is left to
       your discretion. You are not required to distribute them to any
       independent  nodes  in your region, though you may if you wish.
       You  must make all these documents available for downloading by
       the general user.
     
     
     5.9 Selection
     
       The Regional Coordinator is selected, from amongst the ranks of
       the  SysOps  in  the  region,  by  the Network Coordinators, by
       democratic  election process. This process to be held according
       to  balloting  procedures  described  later  on  a 'One Network
       Coordinator, one vote' principle.
     
       The  Zone  Coordinator  may veto the result of the election and
       call  for  a new election. Under all circumstances, the results
       of the second election are binding.
     
       A Regional Coordinator can be removed by either an absolute 2/3
     EMBBS 1-13                   Page 27                   2 Oct 1989


       majority  of  the  Network  Coordinators, or by the impeachment
       process  described elsewhere in this document. Neither of these
       processes requires specific policy violations.
     
     
     6   Zone Coordinator Procedures
     
     6.1  General
     
       A  Zone  Coordinator  for  FidoNet  has  the  primary  task  of
       maintaining  the  node  list  for the Zone, sharing it with the
       other  Zone  Coordinators, and ensuring the distribution of the
       master node list (or update) to the Regions in the Zone. A Zone
       Coordinator   is   also   responsible   for   coordinating  the
       distribution  of  Network  Policy documents and FidoNews to the
       Regional Coordinators in the zone.
     
       A  Zone  Coordinator  is  charged with the task of ensuring the
       smooth  operation  of the Zone. This is performed by overseeing
       the operation of the various Regional Coordinators and the Zone
       Gates.
     
       If a Zone Coordinator determines that a Regional Coordinator is
       not  properly  performing  required duties (as outlined above),
       then  a  replacement  for  that  Regional Coordinator should be
       sought, or other action as deemed fit.
     
       The  Zone  Coordinator defines the geographic boundaries of the
       regions within the zone.
     
       The Zone Coordinator is responsible for reviewing and approving
       any  geographic  exemptions  as  described  elsewhere  in  this
       document.
     
       The  Zone Coordinators are responsible for the selection of the
       International Coordinator.
     
       The  Zone Coordinator also is responsible for the node list for
       that  administrative  region. The Administrative Region has the
       same  number  as  the  zone, and consists of nodes assigned for
       administrative   purposes   not  related  to  the  sending  and
       receiving of normal network mail.
     
     
     6.2  Selection
     
       The Zone Coordinator is selected, from amongst the ranks of the
       SysOps  in  the  Zone,  by  all the Coordinators, by democratic
       election   process.  This  process  to  be  held  according  to
       balloting procedures described later on a 'One Coordinator, one
       vote' principle.
     
       The  International  Coordinator  may  veto  the  result  of the
       election and call for a new election.  Under all circumstances,
       the results of the second election are binding.
     
     EMBBS 1-13                   Page 28                   2 Oct 1989


       A  Zone  Coordinator  can  be removed by either an absolute 2/3
       majority  of  the  Coordinators,  or by the impeachment process
       described   elsewhere   in  this  document.  Neither  of  these
       processes requires specific policy violations.
     
     
     7   International Coordinator Procedures
     
     7.1  General
     
       The  International Coordinator for FidoNet has the primary task
       of  coordinating the master node list creation, by managing the
       distribution between the Zones of the Zone master node lists.
     
       The   International   Coordinator   is   also  responsible  for
       coordinating the distribution of Network Policies, and FidoNews
       to the Zone Coordinators.
     
       The  International  Coordinator is responsible for coordinating
       the   activities   of   the  Zone  Coordinators'  Council.  The
       International  Coordinator  acts  as the spokesman for the Zone
       Coordinators' Council.
     
       The International Coordinator is responsible for overseeing the
       ratification process for new versions of FidoNet policy.
     
     
     7.2  Selection
     
       The  International  Coordinator  is selected (or removed) by an
       absolute   majority   vote   of   the  Zone  Coordinators.  The
       International  Coordinator is selected from amonst the ranks of
       the FidoNet SysOps.
     
     
     8   Democratic Procedures
     
     8.1  Ballots
     
       There are basically two reasons why a ballot should be taken:-
     
       1) A  new  policy  document  has  been created and it should be
          approved by FidoNet in general.
     
       2) An  administrative  post (*?C) is available to be filled and
          an  election is being used to select the person to fill that
          post.
     
       There  exists in FidoNet the dilemma of mandate. FidoNet is not
       significantly  different from the rest of world, where, for one
       reason  or another, a large portion of the citizenry choose not
       to  participate  in  the  decision  making  process. FidoNet is
       different in that given the ease with which we can communicate,
       continual  argument  is  made  whether the "silent majority" is
       showing  assent with the status quo, or whether they are simply
       too  apathetic to care. Any fully democratic process in FidoNet
     EMBBS 1-13                   Page 29                   2 Oct 1989


       must  be  structured such that when a referendum is held, there
       is  no  question as to whether or not FidoNet as a whole really
       made  a  decision.  The  problem this creates is that NO policy
       changes  might be instituted if it turns out that apathy is the
       ruling force.
     
       In  the case of an election for a *?C post, if less than 20% of
       the SysOps eligible to vote actually cast a vote, the *C at the
       level  above may choose to veto the voting process and directly
       appoint one of the candidates or call for another vote.
     
     
     8.2  General Guidelines
     
     8.2.1  Petition/Announcement Delay
     
       Given  the vagaries of FidoNet, there will always be some delay
       between  the  time  a  Policy  amendment  is  drafted, petition
       signatures  are  gathered and presented (if necessary), and the
       time  a  balloting  announcement is made. In the case of policy
       amendment referenda, this delay might be as long as two months,
       to  allow  more  than  one  petition  to be handled in the same
       ballot.
     
       In  the  case  of  volunteers to fill a vacant post, the ballot
       should  be  prepared by the *C involved and a message or series
       of messages calling for volunteers to fill the post posted in a
       local  EchoMail conference which is available to all interested
       parties.  For guidance this would be:-
     
       *?C to be elected   Election controller   Post messages
       -----------------   -------------------   ---------------------
       NC or NEC           RC/REC/NCC        Local NETWORK SysOp area
       RC or REC           ZC/ZEC/RCC        Local REGIONAL SysOp area
       ZC or ZEC           IC/ZCC/RCC        Zone SysOp area/FidoNews
     
       Note: To  control  the  election  choose  one  or more from the
             election  controllers.  Basically  it's  just  a  case of
             using people that can manage the job.
     
             NCC  ..  Network Cordinator Council  i.e. A group of NC's
                      within the region
             RCC  ..  Regional  Coordinator  Council  i.e.  A group of
                      RC's within the zone
             ZCC  ..  Zone Coordinator Council  i.e. A group of ZC's
     
     
     8.2.2  Discussion Period
     
       In  order  to  provide a discussion period, the announcement of
       any  binding ballot must be made not less than two weeks before
       the date of voting commencement.
     
       Calls  for  volunteers  to  fill vacant *?C positions should be
       made at least two weeks before the date of voting commencement.
     
     EMBBS 1-13                   Page 30                   2 Oct 1989


     8.2.3  Balloting Period
     
       The balloting period should be not less than two weeks.
     
     
     8.2.4  One Vote Per SysOp
     
       Each  SysOp  in FidoNet is entitled to one and only one vote in
       any  referendum  described herein, regardless of how many nodes
       operated.
     
       Intentionally  voting  more than once (unless required due to a
       technical  malfunction  resulting  in  the loss of the original
       ballots) in a given referendum is considered annoying behavior.
       Doing  so  invalidates  all  the  votes  from  that  SysOp, and
       disqualifies that SysOp from that referendum.
     
     
     8.2.5  Voting Mechanism
     
       The  actual  voting  mechanism  (including, but not limited to,
       whether or not the ballot is secret, and how the ballots are to
       be  collected  and  counted)  is  left to the discretion of the
       election controller(s). Ideally, ballot collection should be by
       some secure message system, conducted over FidoNet itself.
     
     
     8.2.6 Announcement, Ballot Distribution, and Results Notification
     
     8.2.6.1  Distribution by Coordinators and FidoNews
     
       Proposed  changes  to  Policy, and impeachment referenda at the
       zone  level,  as  well as all official announcements related to
       them  and  the  results,  are  distributed  by  the coordinator
       structure   with   the   weekly   node   difference  file.  The
       International Coordinator also provides copies to the editor of
       FidoNews   for   inclusion   there,   although   the   official
       announcement   and   voting   dates   are  tied  to  node  list
       distributions.
     
       Impeachment referenda at the Region level and below, as well as
       all  official  announcements  related  to them and the results,
       must   be  published  in  the  appropriate  SysOp  conferences.
       Election  results  for elected *?C posts must also be published
       and  maintained  by  the election controller(s) for a period of
       twelve  months following the completion of the election. Voting
       statistics,  down  to  the  net  level  must  be  published, if
       requested,  for a non-secret ballot. Publication is unnecessary
       unless called for by any voting member.
     
     
     8.2.6.2  Voting Date Announcement
     
       The  voting date is announced at the time of the release of the
       documents for the discussion period.
     
     EMBBS 1-13                   Page 31                   2 Oct 1989


     8.2.6.3  Ballot Distribution
     
     FidoNet level ballots
     
       The actual ballots are distributed by the coordinator structure
       with  the  weekly  node  list  update, on the date of balloting
       commencement.  In  addition, they are provided to the editor of
       FidoNews at the same time.
     
     Intra-zonal ballots
     
       The actual ballots are distributed by the coordinator structure
       in the Zone, Region or Net level SysOp conferences according to
       the  needs  of  the ballot. A ballot for a Regional Coordinator
       would  be distributed in a Regional EchoMail conference and not
       in a zone-wide conference.
     
     
     8.2.6.4  Results Announcement
     
     FidoNet level
     
       The  results  of  any referenda are announced via the node list
       update  distributed by the FidoNet coordinators, not later than
       two  weeks  after the close of voting. In addition, the results
       are provided to the editor of FidoNews.
     
     Intra-zonal level
     
       The  results  of  any referenda are announced via the requisite
       SysOp conference by the election controller(s).
     
     8.3  Checks and balances, Guidelines
     
     8.3.1  Dual Absolute Majorities
     
       In  order to balance the needs of large and small networks, two
       standards must be met to decide a SysOp referendum in FidoNet.
     
       A Policy amendment or impeachment is considered in force if, at
       the  end  of the balloting period, both an absolute majority of
       the SysOps, and an absolute majority of each hierarchical level
       in the FidoNet administration votes in the affirmative.
     
       For  instance, a modification to Policy itself must be ratified
       by  more  than  half  of the zones. A zone ratifies it if it is
       ratified  by  more  than half of its regions. A region ratifies
       it  if  it is ratified by more than half of its local networks.
       A  local  network  ratifies it if more than half of its members
       ratify  it.  (This  process  does  not apply to the routing hub
       level.)  In  addition,  an  absolute  majority of the SysOps in
       total  must  have  voted  in for the proposed Policy change. In
       this  way,  neither  a  small number of large nets, nor a large
       number of small nets can force something on the rest of FidoNet
       - a relatively broad based consensus must be reached.
     
     EMBBS 1-13                   Page 32                   2 Oct 1989


       In the case of the impeachment of a Coordinator, the same rules
       are used, excluding the Coordinator's own level.
     
     
     8.3.2  Eligibility: Nodes in the Node List at Announcement
     
       Any  SysOp  listed  in  the appropriate segments of the FidoNet
       nodelist  issued  immediately  preceding  the announcement of a
       referendum is eligible to vote.
     
     
     8.4  Ratification of changes to policy
     
     8.4.1  General Guidelines
     
     8.4.1.1  Voting is on a whole Policy Document
     
       Given  that  Policy  is  currently  very  intertwined  and self
       referencing,  very often a relatively simple theoretical change
       requires  alteration  of a number of places in the document. If
       multiple  amendments  are  to be chosen from, this could result
       contradictory language.
     
       In  order to simplify the process, balloting is done on choices
       between  whole documents, rather than individual amendments. In
       the  simplest  case,  this  means  voting  yea  or nay to a new
       document.  If  a  number  of alternatives are to be considered,
       they  must be presented as whole documents, from which one must
       be  chosen.  This  lessens  the  chance of contradictions being
       built into Policy during one referendum.
     
       Another  reason for taking this approach is to encourage future
       Policy    formulators   to   at   least   consider   completely
       restructuring  and  rewriting  Policy  rather than patching and
       amending.
     
     
     8.4.2  Limitations Guidelines
     
     8.4.2.1  Not more than twice a year
     
       While democracy is a Good Thing, Too Much of a Good Thing might
       not be, and could quickly get to be quite annoying.  Therefore,
       use  of  this  mechanism  for  policy  changes  is limited to a
       maximum of twice per calendar year.
     
     
     8.4.2.2  Initiation
     
     8.4.2.2.1  "Signatures" of 10% of Node Listed Nodes
     
       The  signatures  of  at  least 10% of the SysOps of FidoNet are
       required in order to initiate a Policy referendum. This applies
       to  EACH  proposed  Policy  to  be  submitted  to  FidoNet  for
       ratification.

     8.5  Impeachment of a Coordinator
     
     8.5.1  General
     
       In extreme cases, a Coordinator may be impeached by referendum.
     
       It  is important to note that impeachment of a Coordinator DOES
       NOT require an actionable Policy violation.
     
     
     8.5.2  Guidelines
     
     8.5.2.1  Passage as per General Guidelines
     
       To  impeach  a  Coordinator  requires a broad based mandate. It
       requires  the  same  dual percentage of an absolute majority of
       the  areas,  and  an  absolute  majority of the SysOps in those
       areas  to  be carried out. An area is defined as Regions in the
       case  of  a  Coordinator  and  Nets  in  the case of a Regional
       Coordinator.
     
     
     8.5.2.2  Limited to once per year
     
       The  removal  of  a  Coordinator  is primarily intended to be a
       mechanism  by  which  the area as a whole expresses displeasure
       with  the  way  Policy  is  being  interpreted.  At one time or
       another,   EVERYONE   is   unhappy   with  the  way  Policy  is
       interpreted.  In  order  to  keep the Coordinators interpreting
       Policy  as  opposed  to  defending  themselves, the use of this
       mechanism  is  limited to once per calendar year (regardless of
       how many people hold the position during that year.)
     
     
     8.5.2.3  Resignation before Impeachment Conclusion
     
       Should  a Coordinator resign during an impeachment process, the
       process  is  considered null and void, and does not consume the
       "once per year" quota.
     
     
     8.5.2.4  Initiation
     
     8.5.2.4.1  "Signatures" of 10% of Node Listed Nodes
     
       The  signatures  of  at least 10% of the SysOps in the affected
       area are required in order to initiate impeachment proceedings.
       This  implies 10% of the Zone in the case of the impeachment of
       a   Zone  Coordinator,  10%  of  the  Region  in  the  case  of
       impeachment of a Regional Coordinator and 10% of the Net in the
       case of impeachment of a Network Coordinator.
     
     
     8.6  Terms of office
     
       A  *?C  should  serve a term of office not exceeding two years.
     EMBBS 1-13                   Page 34                   2 Oct 1989


       Following  the  term  of  office  an election should be held to
       determine  the  occupant of the vacant position. The previously
       serving  SysOp  is  automatically  a  candidate for re-election
       unless specifically stating otherwise and will be automatically
       re-elected unless opposed.
     
     
     9   Resolution of Disputes
     
     9.1   General
     
       The  world  not  being perfect, sometimes troubles crop up. Any
       organization  larger  than  a Cub Scout pack needs some sort of
       grievance procedure, and FidoNet is no exception.
     
       The FidoNet judicial philosophy can be summed up in two rules:
     
            1) Thou shalt not excessively annoy others.
     
            2) Thou shalt not be too easily annoyed.
     
       In  other  words,  there are no hard and fast rules of conduct,
       but  reasonably  polite  behavior  is  expected.  Also,  in any
       dispute  both  sides  are  examined,  and action could be taken
       against  either  or  both  parties.  ("Judge  not,  lest  ye be
       judged!")
     
       The  first step in any dispute between SysOps is for the SysOps
       to  attempt  to  communicate  directly,  at  least  by netmail,
       preferably  by  voice. Any complaint made that has skipped this
       most basic communication step will be rejected out of hand.
     
       Failure  to follow the dispute resolutions herein described (in
       particular,   by   skipping   a  coordinator,  or  involving  a
       coordinator  not  in  the  appeal  chain)  is  in and of itself
       annoying behavior.
     
       Appeals  to the next higher coordinator must be made within two
       weeks of the decision being appealed.
     
     
     9.2   Problems with Another Node
     
       If  you are having problems with another node, you should first
       try  to  work  it out via private netmail or voice conversation
       with the SysOp in question.
     
       If  this  fails to create a satisfactory resolution, you should
       complain   to   your   Network   Coordinator  and  the  Network
       Coordinator  of  the other node involved. If one or both of you
       is  not in a network, then complain to the appropriate Regional
       Coordinator. Should this fail to provide satisfaction, you have
       the  right to appeal to the Regional and Zone Coordinators, and
       if   the   problem  is  inter-zonal  in  nature,  to  the  Zone
       Coordinators as a group via the International Coordinator.

     9.3   Problems with a Network Coordinator
     
       If  you  are  having problems with your Network Coordinator and
       feel  that you are not being treated properly, you are entitled
       to  due  process  and a thorough review of your situation under
       Policy.  There are a few things you can do.
     
       The  first  step is to contact your Regional Coordinator. If it
       is felt that your case has merit, then there are several things
       which   might   occur.   There  may  be  a  change  of  Network
       Coordinators, or even a disbanding of your network, though this
       is  unlikely. It is much more likely you would be ordered to be
       re-instated.
     
       If  you  fail  to obtain relief from your Regional Coordinator,
       then you can appeal to the Zone Coordinator.
     
     
     9.4   Problems with a Regional Coordinator
     
       If you are having problems with your Regional Coordinator, then
       you should first try to join or form a network in your area. If
       this fails, you can appeal to the Zone Coordinator.
     
     
     9.5   Appeals to the Zone Coordinator
     
       If   you  are  unable  to  obtain  relief  from  your  Regional
       Coordinator,  then  you  can appeal to the Zone Coordinator. If
       your  case  is sufficiently extreme and meritorious, then there
       may be a change of Regional Coordinators, but this is unlikely.
       Also,   the  first  step  taken  by  the  Zone  Coordinator  in
       investigating   any   dispute   is   to  contact  any  Regional
       Coordinators  and  Network  Coordinators concerned. If you have
       not  followed  the  proper  channels,  then  your  case will be
       dismissed  out  of  hand.  In other words, don't go to the Zone
       Coordinator until you have tried everything else.
     
     
     9.6   Problems with the Zone Coordinator
     
       If  your  problem  is  of an interzonal nature an appeal may be
       submitted   to   the   International  Coordinator,  who,  after
       verifying   all  levels  of  appeal  have  been  pursued,  will
       present  it  to  the  Zone  Coordinators  as  a group. The Zone
       Coordinators  may decide to either reject your complaint as not
       interzonal in nature, or rule on its merits.
     
       If  your  problem is with a Zone Coordinator per se, that is, a
       Zone  Coordinator has committed a Policy violation against you,
       your   complaint   should   be  filed  with  the  International
       Coordinator,  who will submit it to the other Zone Coordinators
       for possible consideration.
     
       Should  all  this  fail, you have three remaining options: live
       with  it,  appeal  to  the Regional Coordinators of the Zone to
     EMBBS 1-13                   Page 36                   2 Oct 1989


       impeach   their   Zone   Coordinator,   or  start  a  "popular"
       impeachment  drive.  The  latter  two  are  the final levels of
       appeal in FidoNet.
     
     
     9.7   Statute of Limitations
     
       A  complaint  may not be filed more than 60 days after the date
       of  discovery  of  the  source  of  the  infraction,  either by
       admission,  or  technical evidence. Complaints may not be filed
       more  than  120  days  after  the  incident unless they involve
       explicitly illegal behavior involving the network that has been
       substantiated by some legal proceeding.
     
     
     9.8   Right to a Decision within a limited time frame
     
       A  coordinator  is  required  to  render  a final decision, and
       notify  the  parties involved, within 60 days of the receipt of
       the complaint or appeal.
     
     
     9.9   Return to Original Network
     
       Once  a  policy  dispute  is resolved, any nodes re-instated on
       appeal  are  to  be  returned to the local network or region to
       which they geographically or technically belong.
     
     
     9.10  EchoMail
     
       EchoMail is an important and powerful force in FidoNet. For the
       purposes  of  Policy  Disputes,  EchoMail is simply a different
       flavor  of Net Mail, and is therefore covered by Policy. By its
       nature,  EchoMail places unique technical and social demands on
       the  net  over  and above those covered by this version of this
       document.  In  recognition  of  this,  an echomail policy which
       extends (and does not contradict) general Policy, maintained by
       the EchoMail Coordinators, and ratified by a process similar to
       that  of  this  document,  shall  be  recognized by the FidoNet
       Coordinators  as  a  valid  structure for dispute resolution on
       matters  pertaining  to  echomail.  At some future date, by the
       ratification  process described elsewhere in this document, the
       echomail policy document may be merged with this one.
     
     
     10  Appendices
     
     10.1  General
     
       The  Appendices  of  this document are exceptions to the normal
       ratification  process.  Each  is  handled  differently, with an
       explanation of how and why.
     
     
     10.2  Timing of Zone Mail Hour
     EMBBS 1-13                   Page 37                   2 Oct 1989


     Zone  Mail  Hour  is  observed  each  day, including weekends and
     holidays.  The  time  is  based  upon  Universal Coordinated Time
     (UCT),  also  known  as Greenwich Mean time (GMT). In areas which
     observe  Daylight Savings Time during part of the year, the local
     time  of  zone  mail  hour  will  change because FidoNet does not
     observe Daylight Savings Time. The exact timing of Zone Mail Hour
     is set for each zone by the Zone Coordinator.
     
     In  FidoNet  Zone 1, Zone Mail Hour is observed from 0900 to 1000
     UCT.  In each of the time zones, this is:
     
       Eastern Standard Time               04:00 to 05:00
       Central Standard Time               03:00 to 04:00
       Mountain Standard Time              02:00 to 03:00
       Pacific Standard Time               01:00 to 02:00
       Hawaii Standard Time                23:00 to 00:00
     
     In  FidoNet  Zone 2, Zone Mail Hour is observed from 0230 to 0330
     UCT.

       list of the available flags, see the latest nodelist.
     
     
     10.4  Case Histories
     
     10.4.1   General
     
     Case  histories  of past disputes are instructive to show general
     procedures  and  methods.  Any  decision  may be included in this
     document  by  a  majority  vote  of  either  the Zone Coordinator
     Council or the Regional Coordinators.
     
     Policy4  significantly  changes  the  functions  of  the Zone and
     International  Coordinators.  In  the  following cases which were
     decided  using  Policy3,  substitute  "Zone  Coordinator" for all
     occurrences of "International Coordinator(*)".
     
     
     10.4.2  The Case of the Crooked Node
     
     A  SysOp  of  a  local  node  was using network mail to engage in
     unethical  business  practices.  The  Network  Coordinator became
     very  annoyed  at  this, and dropped the local from the nodelist.
     
     The  local appealed to the Regional Coordinator for assignment as
     an  independent  node.  The  Regional Coordinator, after checking
     with   the   Network   Coordinator,   decided  that  the  Network
     Coordinator  was  right  to  be  annoyed.  Independent status was
     denied.
     
     The International Coordinator(*) did not intervene.
     
     
     10.4.3  The Case of the Hacker Mailer
     
     A SysOp of a local node made use of file attaches for extra users
     to  self-mail  the  USER.BBS  file from several local boards. The
     SysOps  of  these  boards  felt  annoyed at this, and appealed to
     their  Network  Coordinator, who agreed and dropped the offending
     node from the nodelist.
     
     The Regional Coordinator was not consulted.
     
     The International Coordinator(*) did not intervene.
     
     
     10.4.4  The Case of the Bothered Barker
     
     A  local  node  became  annoyed  with the Network Coordinator for
     failing  to  provide services. Repeated complaints to the Network
     Coordinator  were  not satisfactory to the node, so an appeal was
     made to the International Coordinator(*).
     
     The  International Coordinator(*) dismissed the complaint because
     the Regional Coordinator had not been consulted.
     
     EMBBS 1-13                   Page 40                   2 Oct 1989


     The   local   node   submitted  the  complaint  to  the  Regional
     Coordinator,  who investigated the case and discovered that there
     was  some  justice  to  the  complaint.  The Regional Coordinator
     advised  and  assisted the Network Coordinator in configuring the
     system  to  provide  an  improved  level  of service to the local
     nodes.
     
     The  Regional  Coordinator  also  decided that the local node was
     being too easily annoyed, in that the node was expecting services
     not  normally  required  of a Network Coordinator. The local node
     was  informed as to the true duties of a Network Coordinator, and
     was advised to lower expectations.
     
     
     10.4.5  The Case of the Busy Beaver
     
     A  local  node  which  was operated by a retail establishment was
     engaged  in  making  "bombing  runs"  to mail advertisements over
     FidoNet.  The  Network  Coordinator felt annoyed and handling the
     outgoing  traffic for a commercial operation, and asked the local
     node to leave the network.
     
     The  local  node  applied  to  the  Regional Coordinator, and was
     granted status as an independent node in the region.
     
     
     10.4.6  The Mark of the Devil
     
     A  local  SysOp  whose  board was used in conjunction with voodoo
     rites,  hacking,  phreaking,  and  obscene  material applied to a
     Network  Coordinator  for  a node number. The Network Coordinator
     deemed that this board was exceptionally annoying, and denied the
     request.
     
     The Regional Coordinator was not consulted.
     
     The  International  Coordinator(*),  on  seeing that the Regional
     Coordinator  had  not  been  consulted, dismissed the case out of
     hand.  No further appeals were made.
     
     
     10.4.7  The Case of the SysOp Twit
     
     A  patron  of  various local nodes had been roundly recognized by
     all  SysOps  as a twit. The user obtained an own system, became a
     SysOp,  and  applied  for  a node number. The Network Coordinator
     denied the request.  No appeals were made.
     
     
     10.4.8  The Case of the Echomail Junkie
     
     A  local  node  became  enamored with echomail and joined several
     conferences,  routing  mail  through  the  network. The node then
     started  an  own  echomail conference and began relaying echomail
     between  several  systems,  again  routing  it  all  through  the
     network.
     EMBBS 1-13                   Page 41                   2 Oct 1989


     The  Network  Coordinator  observed  that network performance was
     becoming seriously impaired.  The offending node was told to hold
     it  down.  A  compromise was reached whereby much of the echomail
     traffic  was  no  longer  routed  through the network, and routed
     echomail  was  limited  to  twenty messages per night. No appeals
     were made.
     
     
     10.4.9  The Case of the Bouncing Board
     
     A  local  user  decided  to  establish a node to promote a worthy
     charity.  The  machine being used was also used for various other
     activities  during  the day, and the SysOp was often called away.
     Co-workers would often forget to bring the board up at the end of
     the  day while the SysOp was away, so the node was often down for
     extended  periods.  The  Network  Coordinator,  finding  the node
     unable  to  receive  mail,  would  mark  it down. The SysOp would
     return, restart the board, and ask to be reinstated.
     
     The Network Coordinator eventually decided that the SysOp was not
     able to maintain a reliable system, and removed the node from the
     nodelist  completely.  Subsequent requests for a node number from
     the same SysOp were turned down. No appeals were made.

                               WEEKLY PUZZLE
     =================================================================


     This week's puzzle. Serialnr. 8913.
     
     Playing with gold...
     
     Long time ago in the west, before white man took over, there were
     a  number  of indians sitting around a campfire. Everyone of them
     had  a  certain amount of golden pieces. The first indian had one
     piece  more than the second who has one piece more then the third
     and  so  on..  All willing to share their wealth with the others,
     the  first indian gives one piece to the second. The second gives
     two  pieces  to the third.. Everyone gives one piece more than he
     gets..  As  long  as that's possible.. At the beginning (and also
     at  the end) there are two indians sitting next to each other, of
     who one has four times as much gold as the second.
     
     So,  the  question  is,  how  many indians were sitting round the
     fire, and how much gold did the poorest indian had to start with.
     
     Happy puzzling,
